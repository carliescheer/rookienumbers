## Overview of the site: 
1. **About**: Get to know me and my goals.
2. **Weekly Predictions**: Check here each week for my predictions for the upcoming week. I'll try to post these each Sunday for the upcoming week (Monday through the following Sunday); as a student, though, I can't make any promises. Basically, I'll be outlining bets I think are smart based on data I've collected or things I've observed. I'll probably stick to 10 or so games each week, but that number may be smaller or larger based on the week and based on how I decide to do things. 
3. **Weekly Analysis**: This will be posted (hopefully) on the Monday after the week I've predicted ends. I'll just be discussing where I went right, and where I went wrong - probably much more of the latter. I'm basically looking at this as a documentation of what I've learned over time. 

## How to understand the charts: 
1. Predicted Wins: I've arranged the teams by a variable I've created called the win multiplier. Teams with a higher win multiplier are at the top, and that means I've decided (well, the data has) that if they are predicted to win, you'd probably be alright betting on them; as always, consider the other team as well. The opposite is true as well: if a team is at the bottom of the win multipliers, I would probably bet *against* the spread if they are predicted to win. 
2. Predicted Losses: It's the same idea, except teams toward the top of the loss multiplier are teams that I would consider betting on the spread for if they're projected to lose. At the bottom are the teams who are projected to lose and also happen to lose pretty badly when they are. 
3. I've organized this by conference because it's easier when I analyze the data. Also, please remember that I'm just a college kid doing this as a hobby so I don't have time to analyze every team. Right now I'm sticking to a few of the Power Five conferences. 

In either case, just remember that either extreme is what we're looking at: stay away from mid-range teams. OH, and, a HUGE thing: account for outliers. If Duke is only projected to lose two times, their multiplier is probably going to be really skewed. That's something I'll mention in my weekly predictions if it comes up, but keep this in mind if you're looking for yourself as well. 

And as always, remember that UNC sucks (GTHC) and Tom Izzo's teams are always overrated. Thanks for checking this out.
