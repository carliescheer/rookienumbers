    "text": "What to expect\nThis season, I’m hoping to stick with my current method of “placing” weekly bets and immersing myself further into the world of sports and gambling; again, remember that I am not actually using real money for this - it is purely a simulation. I hope that’s clear - I mean, I bolded it and everything. I just figured I should put that disclaimer in there so that one day when I get super famous from this, no one can sue me when they lose a bet I advertised on here.\nEach week, I plan on highlighting the games I’m looking forward to, whether I’m “betting” on them or not. I’ll probably have a few categories: games I’m placing wagers on, games to be weary of, and games I’d stay away from. Who knows - that’s why the site is called “Rookie Numbers.”\nAfter the week is over, I’ll go through each category and summarize the results of each game, discuss whether I won the bet or not, and reflect on how I can adjust for future weeks. This is meant to be a learning experience for me, and I’m going to do my best to track my thought process over time to see where I’m making critical errors or where my judgement is correct (which will probably be rare)."

The only thing I ask is that you keep in mind one thing: I’m doing this for fun and to learn. You’re welcome to disagree with my takes, but I’m not ever claiming to be “correct” or “know” anything. I’m just a kid with a dream of working in the sports industry, and this is the best way I can think of getting started.\nGo Blue Devils!"

    "text": "How to understand the charts:\n\nPredicted Wins: I’ve arranged the teams by a variable I’ve created called the win multiplier. Teams with a higher win multiplier are at the top, and that means I’ve decided (well, the data has) that if they are predicted to win, you’d probably be alright betting on them; as always, consider the other team as well. The opposite is true as well: if a team is at the bottom of the win multipliers, I would probably bet against the spread if they are predicted to win.\nPredicted Losses: It’s the same idea, except teams toward the top of the loss multiplier are teams that I would consider betting on the spread for if they’re projected to lose. At the bottom are the teams who are projected to lose and also happen to lose pretty badly when they are.\nI’ve organized this by conference because it’s easier when I analyze the data. Also, please remember that I’m just a college kid doing this as a hobby so I don’t have time to analyze every team. Right now I’m sticking to a few of the Power Five conferences.\n\nIn either case, just remember that either extreme is what we’re looking at: stay away from mid-range teams. OH, and, a HUGE thing: account for outliers. If Duke is only projected to lose two times, their multiplier is probably going to be really skewed. That’s something I’ll mention in my weekly predictions if it comes up, but keep this in mind if you’re looking for yourself as well.\nAnd as always, remember that UNC sucks (GTHC) and Tom Izzo’s teams are always overrated. Thanks for checking this out."
