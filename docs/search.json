    "text": "What better way to start this than with a disclaimer? I’m just going to put it out there early, because I’m really not in the mood for a lawsuit or for any sort of drama: Everything I’m doing on here, analyzing, or writing is purely for my own enjoyment, for me to learn, and for me to gain real-world experience in a field that I find fascinating. I am not 21; I cannot legally bet. I’m not betting; I’m simply making predictions based on data and my observations. If I refer to something as a “bet,” please know that I am not actually betting - I just don’t have the energy to write “simulated bet” out every time. Take everything you see on here with a grain of salt; the reality is I’m probably no better than any person who randomly places bets based on which team mascot they think sounds cooler. Moral of the story - I’m just trying to have fun with this and learn, and hopefully you will as well. Thanks.\nI typed out a longer version of that in the “About” section, so feel free to check that out if you’re wondering who the person behind the website is. Anyway, the “About” portion is really just a CYA section.\nHere’s an overview of the site before I lose you: 1. About: Get to know me and my goals. 2. Weekly Predictions: Check here each week for my predictions for the upcoming week. I’ll try to post these each Sunday for the upcoming week (Monday through the following Sunday); as a student, though, I can’t make any promises. Basically, I’ll be outlining bets I think are smart based on data I’ve collected or things I’ve observed. I’ll probably stick to 10 or so games each week, but that number may be smaller or larger based on the week and based on how I decide to do things. 3. Weekly Analysis: This will be posted (hopefully) on the Monday after the week I’ve predicted ends. I’ll just be discussing where I went right, and where I went wrong - probably much more of the latter. I’m basically looking at this as a documentation of what I’ve learned over time. 4. Buzzer Beaters: I’ll add fun things to this section that don’t apply to any of the other sections. It’ll essentially just be the place where I mess around and include things that are either important to the college basketball world or random data I’ve analyzed. 5. Archive: This will be where I’ll add the predictions and analysis from past weeks.\nAnd as always, remember that UNC sucks (GTHC) and Tom Izzo’s teams are always overrated. Thanks for checking this out."

    "text": "Who am I? What am I doing here?\nHow’s it going, college basketball fanatics. A new season is upon us! So, the countdown to March begins…\nOk, you’re probably like - who is this kid. Well, I’m currently a student at Duke University with a love for college basketball; I mean, what Duke student isn’t (news flash, there’s actually a lot of them that couldn’t care less). I’m in a program that recently met with the head of analytics for the Boston Celtics - pretty cool, right - and he gave us some great advice, which I’m looking to follow. Future employers, hit me up!\nAnyway, I recently started tracking some sports bets on a spreadsheet for multiple reasons: (1) I find the world of sports to be fascinating, and likewise, the betting industry is booming; (2) I’m not old enough to gamble, I don’t have enough money, and although my parents have offered to place bets for me, I’m a major rule follower; (3) I want to gain experience with “simulated” betting before I start placing bets when it’s legal for me to do so; and, finally, (4) I’m probably a gambling addict in the making. So far, I’ve been tracking college football and dabbling in NFL games, and it’s safe to say I’ve lost more bets than I’ve won. I’m having fun doing it, though! As college basketball season approaches - my true love - I’ve decided to take things more seriously as we prepare for this new season. So here goes nothing.\nWhat to expect\nThis season, I’m hoping to stick with my current method of “placing” weekly bets and immersing myself further into the world of sports and gambling; again, remember that I am not actually using real money for this - it is purely a simulation. I hope that’s clear - I mean, I bolded it and everything. I just figured I should put that disclaimer in there so that one day when I get super famous from this, no one can sue me when they lose a bet I advertised on here.\nEach week, I plan on highlighting the games I’m looking forward to, whether I’m “betting” on them or not. I’ll probably have a few categories: games I’m placing wagers on, games to be weary of, and games I’d stay away from. Who knows - that’s why the site is called “Rookie Numbers.”\nAfter the week is over, I’ll go through each category and summarize the results of each game, discuss whether I won the bet or not, and reflect on how I can adjust for future weeks. This is meant to be a learning experience for me, and I’m going to do my best to track my thought process over time to see where I’m making critical errors or where my judgement is correct (which will probably be rare).\nThe final category is what I’m calling “Buzzer Beaters.” College basketball is crazy. It’s unpredictable. So, this is where I’ll recap either the most interesting games, matchups I’m looking forward to in the future, or big-time news that changes the playing field. Basically, if it isn’t a weekly bet or summary, I’ll post it in this category. Just for fun :)\n19:59 - Let the games begin.\nHopefully you find the idea of this interesting, and if you don’t, you probably didn’t read all the way to this point anyway. I’m excited to get this started, and I hope you are as well. As always, I’m open to any feedback regarding how I can improve or new segments you want me to include. The only thing I ask is that you keep in mind one thing: I’m doing this for fun and to learn. You’re welcome to disagree with my takes, but I’m not ever claiming to be “correct” or “know” anything. I’m just a kid with a dream of working in the sports industry, and this is the best way I can think of getting started.\nGo Blue Devils!"
