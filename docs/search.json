    "text": "What to expect\nThis season, I’m hoping to stick with my current method of “placing” weekly bets and immersing myself further into the world of sports and gambling; again, remember that I am not actually using real money for this - it is purely a simulation. I hope that’s clear - I mean, I bolded it and everything. I just figured I should put that disclaimer in there so that one day when I get super famous from this, no one can sue me when they lose a bet I advertised on here.\nEach week, I plan on highlighting the games I’m looking forward to, whether I’m “betting” on them or not. I’ll probably have a few categories: games I’m placing wagers on, games to be weary of, and games I’d stay away from. Who knows - that’s why the site is called “Rookie Numbers.”\nAfter the week is over, I’ll go through each category and summarize the results of each game, discuss whether I won the bet or not, and reflect on how I can adjust for future weeks. This is meant to be a learning experience for me, and I’m going to do my best to track my thought process over time to see where I’m making critical errors or where my judgement is correct (which will probably be rare).\nThe final category is what I’m calling “Buzzer Beaters.” College basketball is crazy. It’s unpredictable. So, this is where I’ll recap either the most interesting games, matchups I’m looking forward to in the future, or big-time news that changes the playing field. Basically, if it isn’t a weekly bet or summary, I’ll post it in this category. Just for fun :)"
