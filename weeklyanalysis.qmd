## Weeks 1, 2, and 3

There will be no analysis because I am not making predictions yet. This will begin in Week 4. 

## Week 4: 11/27/2023 - 12/3/2023 

# Overview

If you haven't checked out my weekly predictions, go there first. This will be a break-down of those games, where I'll discuss what went well and what went wrong. 

Again, each will be broken down by conference and date. Some summaries may be shorter than others. Note that I do not watch most of the games (sorry), so I won't be providing analysis on the actual game play - just the data I'm seeing, which again isn't much. The only team that you might get some details on is...wait for it...Duke.
